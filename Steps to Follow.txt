Prerequisites -
1. Create an account on Github, and download Git (CLI).
2. Create an account on Heroku Website and downlaod Heroku CLI.
3. pip

Steps to deploy an Streamlit app:
1. Code a Streamlit Webapp using any editor. I have created on VS Code.
   (I have already written the code)
2. Create an Empty Github Repository.
3. Go to CLI (I use Gitbash) and run Git init. 
4. Clone the repository in your local machine using git clone <repo url>.

5. Now make changes in your local machine and make sure to add the following files.
 Necessary Files:
 - your_app.py (Streamlit app Code goes here)
 - requirements.txt (includes all dependencies)
   for requirements.txt
   *  Open Command prompt in Admin Mode and pip install pipreqs.
   *  cd into cloned repo directory
   *  type pipreqs requirements.txt and press enter. Requirements.txt will be created

6. Procfile (without any extension with same name as it is case sensitive)
    copy and paste below contents in the Procfile 
    web: sh setup.sh && streamlit run your_app.py

7. setup.sh (Bash Script file)  - extension - .sh
     copy and paste below contents in the setup.sh
   
mkdir -p ~/.streamlit/

echo "\
[general]\n\
email = \"your_email_address\"\n\
" > ~/.streamlit/credentials.toml

echo "\
[server]\n\
headless = true\n\
enableCORS=false\n\
port = $PORT\n\
" > ~/.streamlit/config.toml


Our File tree is ready. 
Since our github repo only contains a README.md as we have make all changes in 
cloned repo on our machine we need to synchronize both. 

8. Go to the repo directory in CLI usind cd and enter the following commands linewise.
- git add *
- git commit -m "commit message goes here"
- git push

9. Now for Deployment - on the same CLI enter following commands.
- heroku login
        enter any key except q
- heroku create app-name    (app-name is any name we want to give to our app)
- heroku push origin master

10. App is deployed. :)
